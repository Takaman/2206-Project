way pick vps terrible mike penny tim kaine take stage vice presidential debate tuesday night vice president arguably hold second powerful office country part chance president die resign office part president increasingly delegate key duty power post way america choose vice president seem give little weight gravity role presidential candidate pick number two heat campaign vps often represent shortterm electoral interest far readiness job much case year question vp far likely center impact swing state solidify crucial voting bloc experience presidential mettle find might better way thing talk six political scientist study vice presidency turn actually strong defense keep thing one expect constitution require vice president ballot one form another since nation found relieve learn one think way pick vps heat election cycle seem somewhat nutty early michigan sen bob griffin propose amendment constitution would end direct election vice president instead let president appoint vps subject congressional approval sworn course idea go anywhere without supporter especially richard nixon veep spiro agnew resign accusation extortion tax fraud time reporter like tom wicker new york time make case similar mine accord john feerick twentyfifth amendment complete history application wicker write wicker point twofold vps often chosen ruthless political calculation alone voter really get vote whether support vp contemporary political science research back wicker little evidence voter make consideration base vice president say joseph e uscinski political scientist university miami author several study vice presidency think nominee let electoral factor seep choice sometimes give u vice president president president voter want uscinski say need go back see shortterm electoral consideration warp presidential candidate vp pick really worry implication obvious recent example sarah palin sen john mccain hop hail mary comeback poll pick obviously unqualified alaska governor hop fire party base mccain palin lose course mccain certainly theoretically could could die office may risk disastrous presidency part make president choose successor election stake enough historical evidence happen u know unlikely possibility abraham lincoln choose southern white unionist turn white supremacist andrew johnson vp bid geographic diversity lincoln assassinate johnson advance disastrous set reconstruction policy totally odds great emancipator republican base want plus lincoln lost southern state kentucky year anyway discrepancies potus vp also make leadership crisis difficult resolve may even create incentive political assassin uscinski write one recent paper president james garfield shot twice back stubbornly clung life day completely incapacitated lawmaker want resolve crisis make vp chester arthur president fear political implication arthur garfield come different faction completely contradictory policy civil service reform presidential candidate often opt run mate politically different head ticket increase chance win general election uscinski write president vice president differ significantly country could inherit espouse policy country democratically support uscinski argument unqualified vp could become president despite enjoy support much country explicitly look vice president complement ideological profile nominee thereby intentionally insert confusion government could potentially avoid different system vice presidency powder keg risk undemocratic outcome president appoint vps like cabinet member know vox story unlikely spur new constitutional amendment bear never hear president tap unqualified secretary state merely cement vote bloc day right agree messy system number anomaly say joel goldstein law professor st louis university author new book modern vice presidency bottom line system make sense thing consider goldstein lot compel defense current system boil one essential point require vps confirm gridlocked congress norm highlevel presidential appointee could nightmarish right president basically get pick anyone want run mate convention delegate approve choice win landslide ballot box party get veto vp would probably change u tried convert vice presidency position choose election imagine recently elect president hillary clinton try get vp nominee republican senate goldstein say difference thought would good job could get approve would presumably even great current arrangement give congress veto seem less democratic give public veto goldstein say add vice president become increasingly powerful past several decade subject office current partisan warfare seem like promise way improve vp accountability effectiveness vice president become office provide highlevel help president senior political adviser highlevel troubleshooter goldstein say time rest government appear increasingly dysfunctional think mess around upshot political science research clear come impact win medium obsession vp selection dramatically overstate one study recently highlight politico two political scientist find vice president even statistical impact increase vote ticket home state demographic group fall line vp selection neither state say kyle kopko political scientist elizabethtown college conduct research university dayton political scientist chris devine voter think partisan preference presidential candidate say political scientist also argue vp choice make difference even tend expert often find example vp pick really siphon vote away nominee may current system effectively deter presidential nominee pick run mate really hurt chance another reason optimism grow evidence presidential nominee understand importance picking good governing partner illusory electoral gain say matt grossmann political scientist michigan state think president recognize vp mean add matt dickinson political scientist middlebury college recent presidential candidate seem make need govern partner much electoral gain idea sarah palin become president quirk system seem argue maybe also sign voter really punish therefore consider terrible vp pick indeed one study find pick palin cost mccain million vote yes exception fact presidential candidate pick someone election tend force pick pretty good people goldstein say really lose something vice president part campaign;1

actual voter party boss say presidential nomination system know today monthslong sequence stagger primary caucus every state territory come republican adopt similar reform soon afterward first nomination contest reform system iowa democrat slat usual caucus unusually early date january people offer various different explanation deliberate effort help favorite son consider run president

iowa people political community conclude happen tell u something tell u weak frontrunner tell u energy antiwar movement say david yepsen former political reporter de moines register savvy iowan party work hard promote idea iowa early bellwether democrat arrange event topline result could easily report national press republicans moved caucus day create unify event would get lots medium buzz tom

foreignborn people others criticize caucus setup event take long time schedule specific time even absentee vote past depresses turnout could make even unrepresentative four five register party member iowa vast majority independent voter usually nt show think iowa distorts process good way say operative state furthermore democrat nt even get secret ballot mean social pressure could skew result gop side turnout recently dominate evangelical activist many opt candidate lack national appeal like huckabee santorum presidential candidate party long felt compelled voice fealty powerful interest group state like big corn though peverill squire convincingly argue procorn policy mainly driven congress white house finally seem plain unfair lot people state iowa get power caucus defender respond say iowa skew result positively think distorts process good way say crawford hillary clinton organizer iowa state retail campaign oneonone interaction voter rather simply big money ad buy matter voter show nt follow prevail national wind willing give littleknown poorly fund challenger chance help ensure democratic contest overall iowa level play ground say iowa gop operative eric woolson iowa

exceed current low singledigit percent support iowa expect drop soon afterward nightmare scenario clinton point implausible sander win iowa new hampshire happen political elite press mercilessly mock secondguess clinton campaign week yet insider also understand state heavily white representative diverse democratic electorate overall big question whether positive coverage sander get improve performance among nonwhite democrat seem uninterested candidacy far put test next contest south carolina goofy way agree absent clear alternative feel like need decoder ring make sense alone one sat
